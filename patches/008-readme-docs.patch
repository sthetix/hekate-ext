 | emummcforce=1          | Forces the use of emuMMC. If emummc.ini is disabled or not found, then it causes an error. |
 | emummc_force_disable=1 | Disables emuMMC, if it's enabled.                           |
 | stock=1                | OFW via hekate bootloader. Disables unneeded kernel patching and CFW kips when running stock. `If emuMMC is enabled, emummc_force_disable=1` is required. emuMMC is not supported on stock. If additional KIPs are needed other than OFW's, you can define them with `kip1` key. No kip should be used that relies on Atmosphère patching, because it will hang. If `NOGC` is needed, use `kip1patch=nogc`. |
+| ofw=1                  | 100% Stock OFW boot. Bypasses ALL hekate boot processing for instant stock firmware boot (~2-3s). Perfect for online play or when completely clean stock firmware is needed. Only works on units without AutoRCM enabled or Mariko units. This is different from `stock=1` which still processes the boot through hekate. |
 | fullsvcperm=1          | Disables SVC verification (full services permission). Doesn't work with Mesosphere as kernel. |
 | debugmode=1            | Enables Debug mode. Obsolete when used with exosphere as secmon. |
 | kernelprocid=1         | Enables stock kernel process id send/recv patching. Not needed when `pkg3`/`fss0` is used. |
